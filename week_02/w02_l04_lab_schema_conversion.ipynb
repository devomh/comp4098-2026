    "You are designing a database for a **City Library System**. Here are the complete requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Entities & Attributes:**\n",
    "1. **Members** can borrow books. Track their: membership number, full name, email, and phone number (members can have multiple phone numbers).\n",
    "2. **Books** in the library catalog. Track: ISBN, title, author name, publication year, and genre.\n",
    "3. **Physical Copies** of books exist (multiple copies of the same book). Each copy has: a unique barcode, condition (New/Good/Fair/Poor), and shelf location.\n",
    "4. **Authors** write books. Track: author ID, full name, country of origin, and birth year.\n",
    "5. **Borrowing Records** track when a member borrows a physical copy. Record: borrow date, due date, and return date (NULL if not yet returned).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relationships:**\n",
    "1. A **Member** can borrow many **Physical Copies** over time, and a **Physical Copy** can be borrowed by many **Members** over time. (M:N - through Borrowing Records)\n",
    "2. A **Book** can have many **Physical Copies**, but each **Physical Copy** belongs to exactly one **Book**. (1:N)\n",
    "3. An **Author** can write many **Books**, and a **Book** can have many **Authors** (co-authorship is common). (M:N)\n",
    "4. A **Book** can have a **Sequel** (which is also a Book). Track this relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Rules:**\n",
    "- A member cannot borrow the same physical copy twice simultaneously.\n",
    "- Phone numbers are multivalued (some members have multiple contacts).\n",
    "- Physical copies are weak entities (they don't exist without a book).\n",

    "### Part C: Reflection Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer these questions to solidify your understanding:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Why don't we show `book_isbn` as an FK column in `PHYSICAL_COPY` in the pure ER diagram (Part A), but we do show it in the relational schema (Part B)?**\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>Answer</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "In a **pure ER diagram**, the relationship line (`BOOK ||--o{ PHYSICAL_COPY`) already represents the connection - the FK is *implied* by the 1:N relationship. The ER model is conceptual and focuses on \"what is related to what.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **relational schema**, we need to specify *how* that relationship is implemented in the database - through an explicit FK column. This is an implementation detail that belongs to the logical/physical layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What is the composite primary key of the `borrowing_records` table, and why does it need three columns?**\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>Answer</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "The composite PK is: `(membership_number, barcode, borrow_date)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We need `membership_number` + `barcode` because this junction table links members and copies\n",
    "- We also need `borrow_date` because the **same member can borrow the same copy multiple times** (at different points in time - after returning it the first time)\n",
    "- Without `borrow_date`, we couldn't distinguish between the first borrowing and subsequent borrowings of the same copy by the same member\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a special case where a junction table needs more than just the two FKs as its PK.\n",
    "\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **How does the relational model handle the multivalued `phone_numbers` attribute from the ER model?**\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>Answer</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "A **multivalued attribute** in the ER model (shown with special notation in Chen diagrams) becomes a **separate table** in the relational model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `MEMBER_PHONE` entity/table follows the 1:N pattern:\n",
    "- One member can have many phone numbers\n",
    "- The `membership_number` FK links back to the member\n",
    "- The composite PK `(membership_number, phone_number)` ensures we can't accidentally enter the same phone number twice for the same member\n",
    "\n",
    "This transformation maintains **First Normal Form (1NF)** - no multi-valued cells.\n",

    "## 8. Summary\n",
    "You have now converted a visual diagram into a set of strict table definitions, and practiced the critical distinction between **ER diagrams** (conceptual) and **Relational schemas** (implementation).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "- ER diagrams focus on **what** data exists (business concepts)\n",
    "- Relational schemas focus on **how** data is stored (implementation)\n",
    "- The comparison table in `w02_l03_concept_er_modeling.md` is your reference guide\n",
