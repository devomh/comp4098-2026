# Week 01: Foundations of Data Management

## Overview
This week introduces the fundamentals of data management, focusing on the data lifecycle and the shift from database administration to data architecture. You'll learn why modern Data Scientists need to understand not just how to query data, but how to architect entire data systems.

## Lesson 01: Introduction & The Data Lifecycle

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Map the 5 stages of the **Data Lifecycle** to specific tools in the Data Science stack
- Explain the shift from Database Administration to Data Architecture
- Define **ACID** properties and explain why they matter for data integrity
- Visualize where OLTP (Transactional) and OLAP (Analytical) systems fit in the pipeline

## Key Concepts
- **The Data Lifecycle:** Capture → Store → Process → Analyze → Archive
- **ACID Properties:** Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability
- **OLTP vs OLAP:** Transactional systems vs Analytical systems
- **Data Architecture:** Moving from data consumer to data architect

## Next Steps
After completing Lesson 01, you'll be ready to dive into the Relational Model in Lesson 02, where you'll learn about relations, keys, and referential integrity.
