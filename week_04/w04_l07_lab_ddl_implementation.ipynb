    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! In this lab, you have successfully:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ✅ Connected to a PostgreSQL database from a Jupyter notebook\n",
    "2. ✅ Implemented a complete normalized schema with DDL statements\n",
    "3. ✅ Created tables in the correct dependency order (parents before children)\n",
    "4. ✅ Applied all constraint types:\n",
    "   - NOT NULL (required fields)\n",
    "   - UNIQUE (candidate keys)\n",
    "   - CHECK (domain constraints)\n",
    "   - PRIMARY KEY (unique identifiers)\n",
    "   - FOREIGN KEY (referential integrity)\n",
    "5. ✅ Tested constraint enforcement by attempting invalid insertions\n",
    "6. ✅ Used ALTER statements to modify schemas\n",
    "7. ✅ Queried information_schema to document your database\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Constraints enforce business rules** - The database prevents bad data automatically\n",
    "- **Foreign keys enforce referential integrity** - You can't orphan records\n",
    "- **Schema design requires planning** - Create parent tables before child tables\n",
    "- **ALTER TABLE is powerful but dangerous** - Always back up before schema changes\n",
    "- **Documentation is critical** - Use information_schema to understand existing databases\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## Troubleshooting\n",
    "\n",
    "### Connection Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** Can't connect to PostgreSQL\n",
    "- **Solution:** Double-check your connection string format\n",
    "- **Solution:** Verify your password doesn't contain special characters (or URL-encode them)\n",
    "- **Solution:** Ensure the PostgreSQL service is running (`!service postgresql status`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraint Violations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** \"violates foreign key constraint\"\n",
    "- **Solution:** Insert parent records before child records\n",
    "- **Solution:** Verify the referenced value actually exists\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** \"violates check constraint\"\n",
    "- **Solution:** Check your values match the constraint logic\n",
    "- **Solution:** Query information_schema to see exact constraint definition\n",
    "\n",
    "### ALTER TABLE Failures\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** Can't add NOT NULL column to existing table\n",
    "- **Solution:** Add with DEFAULT value, or update existing NULLs first\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** Can't drop column that's referenced by foreign key\n",
    "- **Solution:** Use `DROP COLUMN ... CASCADE` (but be careful!)"
